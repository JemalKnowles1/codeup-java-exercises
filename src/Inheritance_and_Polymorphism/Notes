OOP - Object-oriented programming

- A programming paradigm where state (data/properties) and behavior (functionality/methods)
    are grouped together (often into objects).

 - Objects in Java are created from classes (a blueprint for an object/instance)

 -- ADVANTAGES OF OOP --

  Programming in an Object-oriented way can be used to develop code with a clearer and more modular organization in the following ways:

    - implementation details can be abstracted away making code more readable (Abstraction)
    - restriction of access to various levels of abstraction preventing data inconsistencies (Encapsulation)
    - duplication is minimized through inheritance hierarchies (Inheritance)
    - flexible code where multiple implementations may be swapped out behind a common interface (Polymorphism)


    -- THE FOUR PILLARS OF OOP --

    1. Abstraction - keep it clean
    2. Encapsulation - keep it contained
    3. Inheritance - keep it hierarchical (DRY)
    4. Polymorphism - keep it versatile
